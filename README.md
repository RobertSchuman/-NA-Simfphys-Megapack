# -NA-Simfphys-Megapack
My MegaPack for all my vehicles i've created, this is specifically used for the user getting the newest updates and the community to edit vehicles and upload the fixed scripts, so I can help moderate the trash I post better.

<h1> TUNING INSTRUCTIONS </h1>

If you believe a vehicle should be tuned in some kind of way, you can simply find the file in github, then create a fork and pull request based off your editing changes.

If I accept them, they will be appointed back here to the main pack and public, else they will stay on yours untill further changes are made for me to deam acceptable.
